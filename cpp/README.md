core_math/: This directory is the foundational layer [L1:34] for almost all other cryptographic algorithms. Implement these robustly first.
    ◦ BigInt.h/cpp: C++ lacks native arbitrary-precision integers, which are essential for handling the large numbers (e.g., 1024-bit primes for RSA [L1:3, L2:104] or 255-bit numbers for X25519 [L7:15, L7:141]). You'll need to implement this from scratch or integrate a third-party library. This will be the base for all large number arithmetic.
    ◦ ModularArithmetic.h/cpp: Implements basic modular operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and, crucially, modular inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm [L1:3, L1:5, L2:9, L3:9, L7:176]. Modular exponentiation (square-and-multiply) [L2:6, L3:3, L7:19, L7:94-96, L7:184-186] would also reside here, or be a method of BigInt if designed as a class.
    ◦ FiniteField.h/cpp: Provides an abstract base or template classes for operations within finite fields. You might use C++ templates to write generic field operations that can work for both Fp and F2n types.
    ◦ Fp.h/cpp: Specific implementations for operations over prime fields $F_p = \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ [L1:9, L1:13, L1:63]. This will heavily rely on BigInt and ModularArithmetic.
    ◦ F2n.h/cpp: Implementations for operations over binary extension fields $F_{2^n}$ (e.g., $F_{2^8}$ for AES [L3:134, L4:201] and re-keying [L1:34]). This involves polynomial arithmetic over $F_2[X]/(P(X))$ where $P(X)$ is an irreducible polynomial [L3:133].
    ◦ PolyArithmetic.h/cpp: General polynomial operations (addition, multiplication, modular reduction) which will be used by F2n and KyberArithmetic.
    ◦ MultiPrecision.h/cpp: Contains algorithms for multi-precision addition, operand scanning multiplication [L6:175-177, L7:251, Ex4:1], and product scanning multiplication [L6:177, L7:252]. This will be used in implementations like Poly1305 and X25519.
    ◦ PseudoMersenneReduction.h/cpp: Implements the efficient modular reduction algorithm for primes of the form $2^b - c$, critical for Poly1305 ($2^{130}-5$) [L6:118] and X25519 ($2^{255}-19$) [L7:19, L7:141, Ex4:2].
3. classical_pkc/: This section covers early public-key cryptosystems based on number theory.
    ◦ RSA.h/cpp: Implement RSA key generation (choosing large primes $p, q$, calculating $n=pq$, selecting $e, d$ using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm) [L1:3, L2:100], encryption ($x^e \pmod n$) and decryption ($c^d \pmod n$) [L1:4, L2:100]. Also consider adding the RSA signature scheme [L1:7, L2:140].
    ◦ ElGamal.h/cpp: Implement El Gamal key generation (choosing a finite field $K$, generator $g$, secret $a$, and public $g^a$) [L1:9, L2:111], encryption ($g^x, m \cdot g^{ax}$) [L1:9], and decryption ($g^{-ax} \cdot m \cdot g^{ax}$) [L1:10, L2:111]. This relies on the Discrete Logarithm Problem [L1:8, L1:13, L2:112, L2:114].
    ◦ Rabin.h/cpp: Implement Rabin key generation ($n=pq$, secret $p,q$) [L1:15], encryption ($x^2 \pmod n$) [L1:15], and decryption (solving $x^2 \equiv m \pmod n$ using square root extraction modulo $p$ and $q$) [L1:16-17]. Note its equivalence to factorization [L1:14, L1:18].
    ◦ MerkleHellman.h/cpp: Implement the Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem [L1:21-24], including superincreasing sequences, key generation, encryption, and decryption [L1:23-25]. Acknowledge its historical break [L1:26].
4. side_channel_countermeasures/: This crucial section focuses on masking techniques against side-channel attacks.
    ◦ MaskingPrimitives.h/cpp: Core functions for higher-order Boolean masking, specifically the SecAnd (Secure AND gate) [L2:60-61, L5:139] and RefreshMasks algorithms [L2:74]. These are fundamental to the ISW approach [L2:53].
    ◦ SBoxEvaluation.h/cpp: Implement various S-box evaluation methods for masked inputs. Include naive methods (Horner's method, precomputing powers) [L4:118-119], the cyclotomic method [L4:120, L4:122-123, Ex2:2], and the parity-split method [L4:124]. Secure squaring and powering (linear operations in $GF(2^n)$) [L2:72, L4:112] should be handled here.
    ◦ MaskingConversion.h/cpp: Implement secure conversion between Boolean and Arithmetic masking schemes. This involves Goubin's methods for first-order conversion [L5:131-137, Ex3:1] and higher-order modulo addition algorithms like HO-SecAdd and HO-SecAddGoubin [L5:140-143, Ex3:2].
    ◦ RekeyingSchemes.h/cpp: Implement re-keying functions, notably the polynomial ring multiplication $k(x)r(x) \pmod{x^d+1}$ in $GF(2^8)[x]$ [L1:34-36, L1:38]. Also include the branch-free $GF(2^8)$ multiplication to prevent side-channel leakage from conditional branches [L1:45-46].
5. modern_crypto_primitives/: Contains more contemporary symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
    ◦ ChaCha20.h/cpp: Implement the ChaCha20 stream cipher [L6:4-13], focusing on its ARX (Add-Rotate-XOR) operations. Include Quarter Round, Double Round, and Block Function components.
    ◦ Poly1305.h/cpp: Implement the Poly1305 one-time authenticator [L6:14-19]. This involves key clamping, message padding, and universal hashing using polynomial evaluation via Horner's method modulo $2^{130}-5$ [L6:17-18].
    ◦ AEAD.h/cpp: Combine ChaCha20 and Poly1305 into an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) scheme [L6:27-29].
    ◦ ECC.h/cpp: General elliptic curve arithmetic, defining point addition and doubling (including different coordinate systems like affine or projective [L4:128-130]). This serves as a base for specific curves.
    ◦ X25519.h/cpp: Specifically implement the X25519 key exchange (ECDH) [L7:17]. This will utilize the Montgomery Ladder for scalar multiplication [L7:4] with constant-time swaps [L7:6] and randomized projective coordinates [L7:13]. It heavily relies on PseudoMersenneReduction for $F_{2^{255}-19}$ arithmetic [L7:19, L7:141].
6. post_quantum_crypto/: Dedicated to algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.
    ◦ KyberKem.h/cpp: Implement the CRYSTALS-KYBER Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) [L8:19-23]. This includes key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation based on Module-LWE [L8:17-18].
    ◦ KyberArithmetic.h/cpp: Handles the specific polynomial arithmetic in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^n+1)$ required by Kyber [L8:26-27], including the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT) for efficient polynomial multiplication [L8:28-30].
7. utils/: General utility functions used across various modules.
    ◦ PrimalityTests.h/cpp: Implement probabilistic primality tests like Miller-Rabin [L2:105-107, L7:236] and potentially the Lucas primality test [L2:237, L2:28].
    ◦ FactorizationAlgs.h/cpp: Implement factorization algorithms like Pollard's p-1 method [L2:35-36, L7:35-36] and Pollard's Rho method [L2:39-40, L7:39]. You could also conceptually outline or implement simplified versions of algorithms like the Quadratic Sieve [L2:45, L7:45] or ECM [L2:37, L4:51, L7:37].
    ◦ RNG.h/cpp: Implement secure (cryptographically strong) random number generation, which is crucial for key generation and masking [L2:58].
8. examples/: This directory will contain executable programs to demonstrate and test your implementations.
    ◦ rsa_demo.cpp: An end-to-end RSA encryption/decryption/signature example.
    ◦ sbox_masking_test.cpp: Demonstrates different S-box masking complexities.
    ◦ chacha20_poly1305_test.cpp: Shows ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD operations.
    ◦ x25519_exchange.cpp: Simulates an X25519 key exchange.
    ◦ kyber_test.cpp: A basic Kyber KEM encapsulation/decapsulation test.
    ◦ main.cpp: A central point to run various demonstrations or a menu for selection.
C++ Specific Implementation Advice:
• Header (.h/.hpp) and Source (.cpp) Files: Follow standard C++ practice. Declare classes, functions, and global variables in headers and define them in source files.
• Classes and Objects: Model cryptographic entities (keys, points, states) as classes. For instance, an RSAKeyPair class, ECPoint class, MaskedValue class.
• Namespaces: Use namespaces (e.g., adv_crypto::ClassicalPKC, adv_crypto::CoreMath) to avoid naming collisions and better organize your code.
• Templates: Consider using C++ templates for algorithms that operate generically over different data types (e.g., FiniteField<T>, where T could be an integer type or BigInt).
• Constants and Parameters: Define cryptographic parameters (e.g., AES S-box, ChaCha20 constants, curve parameters) as static constants or configurable parameters within their respective classes/modules.
• Error Handling: Implement robust error handling (exceptions, return codes) for invalid inputs, failed operations, etc.
• Testing Frameworks: Integrate a C++ unit testing framework (e.g., Google Test, Catch2) early. Writing unit tests for each function as you implement it is critical for correctness in cryptography.
• Performance: C++ offers low-level control, allowing you to optimize for performance (e.g., using unsigned int/uint64_t for w-bit limbs in multi-precision arithmetic, avoiding dynamic memory allocation in critical paths).
• SageMath Integration (for testing): While you're implementing in C++, remember that SageMath [L2:155, Ex1:5] can be an invaluable tool for generating test vectors or verifying intermediate results for complex algorithms. You can generate inputs/outputs in SageMath and then test your C++ code against these known correct values.
