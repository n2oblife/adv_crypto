## Step 1: Understanding the Problem Setup

First, I had to interpret what we're working with:
- **Field**: $\mathbb{F}_{2^5}$ with $n=5$, so we work modulo $2^5-1 = 31$
- **Cyclotomic class definition**: $C_\alpha = \{ \alpha \cdot 2^i \bmod{31} : i \in [0,4]\}$
- **Goal**: Find all cyclotomic classes and classify exponents by masking complexity

The key insight is that cyclotomic classes partition the set $\{0,1,2,...,30\}$ based on multiplication by powers of 2.

## Step 2: Computing Cyclotomic Classes Systematically

I used a systematic approach to find all classes:

**Method**: Start with the smallest unassigned element and compute its entire class.

**Example for $C_1$**:
- Start with $\alpha = 1$
- Compute: $1 \cdot 2^0 = 1$, $1 \cdot 2^1 = 2$, $1 \cdot 2^2 = 4$, $1 \cdot 2^3 = 8$, $1 \cdot 2^4 = 16$
- All modulo 31, so $C_1 = \{1,2,4,8,16\}$

**Why this works**: Since we're multiplying by powers of 2, we eventually cycle back (because $2^5 \equiv 32 \equiv 1 \pmod{31}$ in this case).

**Systematic process**:
1. Start with 0 → trivial class $\{0\}$
2. Next unassigned: 1 → compute $C_1$
3. Next unassigned: 3 → compute $C_3$ 
4. Continue until all elements are assigned

## Step 3: Verification Strategy

After computing each class, I verified:
- **Closure**: Each class is closed under $x \mapsto 2x \bmod 31$
- **Partition**: No overlaps between classes
- **Completeness**: $\sum |C_i| = 31$ (all elements accounted for)

## Step 4: Understanding Masking Complexity

This was the trickier part. Masking complexity refers to the minimum number of multiplications needed to compute $x^\alpha$ securely (resistant to side-channel attacks).

**Key insight**: Elements in the same cyclotomic class have the same masking complexity because they're related by squaring operations, which have the same computational cost.

## Step 5: Analyzing Each Complexity Class

**$\mathcal{M}_0^5 = \{0\}$**: Trivial case, $x^0 = 1$

**$\mathcal{M}_1^5 = C_1$**: Powers of 2 require only squaring
- $x^1 = x$ (0 multiplications, but conventionally counted as 1)
- $x^2 = x \cdot x$ (1 multiplication)  
- $x^4 = (x^2)^2$ (1 additional squaring)
- etc.

**$\mathcal{M}_2^5$**: Need 2 operations
- $x^3 = x \cdot x^2$ (compute $x^2$, then multiply by $x$)
- $x^5 = x \cdot x^4$ (compute $x^4$, then multiply by $x$)
- Since cyclotomic classes preserve complexity: $\mathcal{M}_2^5 = C_3 \cup C_5$

**$\mathcal{M}_3^5$**: Need 3 operations  
- $x^7 = x^3 \cdot x^4$ (need both $x^3$ and $x^4$, then multiply)
- Similar analysis for other classes

## Step 6: Key Insights That Guided My Solution

1. **Cyclotomic classes are computational equivalence classes**: If $\beta \in C_\alpha$, then $\beta = \alpha \cdot 2^k$, so $x^\beta = x^{\alpha \cdot 2^k} = (x^\alpha)^{2^k}$, which has the same multiplication count as $x^\alpha$.

2. **Addition chain perspective**: The masking complexity is essentially the length of the optimal addition chain for the exponent.

3. **Binary representation insight**: Powers of 2 are cheapest because they correspond to repeated squaring.

## Step 7: Systematic Verification

I double-checked by:
- Ensuring all 31 elements were classified
- Verifying cyclotomic class closure properties  
- Checking that complexity assignments made sense from an algorithmic perspective

## The Elegant Result

The final result shows a beautiful structure:
- 1 trivial class of size 1
- 6 non-trivial classes of size 5 each
- Complexity increases with the "distance" from powers of 2
- Perfect correspondence between cyclotomic structure and computational complexity
